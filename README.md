Java wrapper for LastFM's API

This project aims to provide a simple yet powerful Java based library that interfaces with the LastFM API for integrating your own applications with LastFM.

This project is still a WIP. Further usage instructions will be added in the future.

You will have to get your own LastFM API and secret before you can use this library. Follow the instructions here to create your own LastFM API account: https://www.last.fm/api/account/create and obtain your own API key and API secret.


## What works

The following services currently work:

- user.getInfo
- user.getRecentTracks
- user.getTopArtists

## What doesn't work

Pretty much everything else.
